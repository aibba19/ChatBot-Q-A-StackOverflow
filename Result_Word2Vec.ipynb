       "0      Class views in Django  view points to a function, which can be a problem if you want to change only a bit of functionality Yes, I could have million keyword arguments and even more if statements in the function, but I was thinking more of an object oriented approach    For example, I have a page that displays a user This page is very similar to page that displays a group, but it's still not so similar to just use another data model Group also has members etc    One way would be to point views to class methods and then extend that class Has anyone tried this approach or has any other idea?     \n",
