What helped me was a surprisingly simple metaclass:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class CallableViewClass(type):\\n    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):\\n        if args and isinstance(args[0], HttpRequest):\\n            instance = super(CallableViewClass, cls).__call__()\\n            return instance.__call__(*args, **kwargs)\\n        else:\\n            instance = super(CallableViewClass, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)\\n            return instance\\n\\n\\nclass View(object):\\n    __metaclass__ = CallableViewClass\\n\\n    def __call__(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\\n        if hasattr(self, request.method):\\n            handler = getattr(self, request.method)\\n            if hasattr(handler, '__call__'):\\n                return handler(request, *args, **kwargs)\\n        return HttpResponseBadRequest('Method Not Allowed', status=405)\\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can now both instantiate view classes and use the instances as view functions, OR I can simply point my URLconf to my class and have the metaclass instantiate (and call) the view class for me. This works by checking the first argument to &lt;code&gt;__call__&lt;/code&gt; â€“ if it's a &lt;code&gt;HttpRequest&lt;/code&gt;, it must be an actual HTTP request because it would be nonsense to attept to instantiate a view class with an &lt;code&gt;HttpRequest&lt;/code&gt; instance.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class MyView(View):\\n    def __init__(self, arg=None):\\n        self.arg = arg\\n    def GET(request):\\n        return HttpResponse(self.arg or 'no args provided')\\n\\n@login_required\\nclass MyOtherView(View):\\n    def POST(request):\\n        pass\\n\\n# And all the following work as expected.\\nurlpatterns = patterns(''\\n    url(r'^myview1$', 'myapp.views.MyView', name='myview1'),\\n    url(r'^myview2$', myapp.views.MyView, name='myview2'),\\n    url(r'^myview3$', myapp.views.MyView('foobar'), name='myview3'),\\n    url(r'^myotherview$', 'myapp.views.MyOtherView', name='otherview'),\\n)\\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(I posted a snippet for this at &lt;a href=\"http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/2041/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"&gt;http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/2041/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;I've created and used my own generic view classes, defining &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;__call__&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; so an instance of the class is callable.  I really like it; while Django's generic views allow some customization through keyword arguments, OO generic views (if their behavior is split into a number of separate methods) can have much more fine-grained customization via subclassing, which lets me repeat myself a lot less.  (I get tired of rewriting the same create/update view logic anytime I need to tweak something Django's generic views don't quite allow).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I've posted some code at &lt;a href=\"http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/1009/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"&gt;djangosnippets.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The only real downside I see is the proliferation of internal method calls, which may impact performance somewhat. I don't think this is much of a concern; it's rare that Python code execution would be your performance bottleneck in a web app.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;: Django's own &lt;a href=\"http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/class-based-views/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"&gt;generic views&lt;/a&gt; are now class-based.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;: FWIW, I've changed my opinion on class-based views since this answer was written. After having used them extensively on a couple of projects, I feel they tend to lead to code that is satisfyingly DRY to write, but very hard to read and maintain later, because functionality is spread across so many different places, and subclasses are so dependent on every implementation detail of the superclasses and mixins. I now feel that &lt;a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/template-response/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"&gt;TemplateResponse&lt;/a&gt; and view decorators is a better answer for decomposing view code.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to share common functionality between pages I suggest you look at custom tags. They're quite &lt;a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.1/howto/custom-template-tags/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"&gt;easy to create&lt;/a&gt;, and are very powerful.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a href=\"https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/ExtendingTemplates\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"&gt;templates can extend from other templates&lt;/a&gt;. This allows you to have a base template to set up the layout of the page and to share this between other templates which fill in the blanks. You can nest templates to any depth; allowing you to specify the layout on separate groups of related pages in one place.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Sounds to me like you're trying to combine things that shouldn't be combined.  If you need to do different processing in your view depending on if it's a User or Group object you're trying to look at then you should use two different view functions.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand there can be common ...</td>\n",

You give groupby an iterable, and a optional &lt;strong&gt;key&lt;/strong&gt; function/callable by which to check the items as they come out of the iterable, and it returns an iterator that gives a two-tuple of the result of the key callable and the actual items in another iterable.

In other words, the &lt;code&gt;groupby&lt;/code&gt; iterator itself returns iterators.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of that, using clearer variable names:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;from itertools import groupby\\n\\nthings = [(&amp;quot;animal&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;bear&amp;quot;), (&amp;quot;animal&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;duck&amp;quot;), (&amp;quot;plant&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;cactus&amp;quot;), (&amp;quot;vehicle&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;speed boat&amp;quot;), (&amp;quot;vehicle&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;school bus&amp;quot;)]\\n\\nfor key, group in groupby(things, lambda x: x[0]):\\n    for thing in group:\\n        print(&amp;quot;A %s is a %s.&amp;quot; % (thing[1], key))\\n    print(&amp;quot;&amp;quot;)\\n    \\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This will give you the output:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;A bear is a animal.&lt;br /&gt;\\nA duck is a animal.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;A cactus is a plant.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;A speed boat is a vehicle.&lt;br /&gt;\\nA school bus is a vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;In this example, &lt;code&gt;things&lt;/code&gt; is a list of tuples where the first item in each tuple is the group the second item belongs to.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;groupby()&lt;/code&gt; function takes two arguments: (1) the data to group and (2) the function to group it with.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;code&gt;lambda x: x[0]&lt;/code&gt; tells &lt;code&gt;groupby()&lt;/code&gt; to use the first item in each tuple as the grouping key.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;In the above &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; statement, &lt;code&gt;groupby&lt;/code&gt; returns three (key, group iterator) pairs - once for each unique key.

It compiles to an executable, and I then have an application executable.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Another system (not mentioned in the accepted answer yet) is PyInstaller, which worked for a PyQt project of mine when py2exe would not. I found it easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.pyinstaller.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"&gt;http://www.pyinstaller.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Pyinstaller is based on Gordon McMillan's Python Installer. Which is no longer available.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;For the GUI itself:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt\" rel=\"noreferrer\"&gt;PyQT&lt;/a&gt; is pretty much the reference.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Another way to develop a rapid user interface is to write a web app,\\nhave it run locally and display the app in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Plus, if you go for the Tkinter option suggested by lubos hasko\\nyou may want to try portablepy to have your app run on Windows environment\\nwithout Python.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Since python is installed on nearly every non-Windows OS by default now, the only thing you really need to make sure of is that all of the non-standard libraries you use are installed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Having said that, it is possible to build executables that include the python interpreter, and any libraries you use.  This is likely to create a large executable, however.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;MacOS X even includes support in the Xcode IDE for creating full standalone GUI apps.  These can be run by any user running OS X.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;There's three things you could do:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The first thing is to find a GUI Designer that can launch its code as standalone applications like .exe files. I use a version of MatDeck (for people using GUI Designers I recommend &lt;a href=\"https://labdeck.com/python-designer/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"&gt;MD Python Designer&lt;/a&gt;) as I believe(I use another version so I'm not too sure.) it allows me to convert the code to a standalone applications and by having it as such, there is no need to install the software on every PC that's going to run the program.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The second option is partially bypassing the problem, launch the GUI as a web page. This would give you the most compatibility as most if not all OS can utilize it. Once again, you would need a GUI Designer that can convert its components into a web compatible format, I've done it once and I used the same version of MatDeck(&lt;a href=\"https://labdeck.com/visionary-deck/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"&gt;Visionary Deck&lt;/a&gt;), I would not recommend MD Python Designer this time as I don't know if it can turn its GUIs into websites using web assembly whereas Visionary Deck I've tried and tested. As with all things there are most likely other software this is just one I use frequently because I work a lot with Mathematics and Physics.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The third option is also kind of bypassing the problem but do it in Tkinter and just ensure you have a Python IDE or just plain old Python and run the code, this will launch the GUI. This is a good solution and maybe the simplest but I wouldn't class it as the shortest or the best. If you only plan to switch between a few operating systems and computers this will probably be your best bet.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# I'd use tkinter for python 3\\n\\nimport tkinter\\n\\ntk = tkinter.Tk()\\ntk.geometry(&amp;quot;400x300+500+300&amp;quot;)\\nl = Label(tk,text=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;)\\nl.pack()\\ne = Entry(tk)\\ne.pack()\\n\\ndef click():\\n    e['text'] = 'You clicked the button'\\n\\nb = Button(tk,text=&amp;quot;Click me&amp;quot;,command=click)\\nb.pack()\\n\\ntk.mainloop()\\n\\n# After this I would you py2exe\\n# search for the use of this module on stakoverflow\\n# otherwise I could edit this to let you know h...</td>\n",

You can find out more at &lt;a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"&gt;modwsgi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I have built and installed this on Solaris without problems. I had previously tried mod_python but ran into problems with shared libraries as part of the build. There are &lt;a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/InstallationInstructions\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"&gt;good install docs&lt;/a&gt; available.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The problem for me wasn't in Apache set up, but in understanding how mod_apache actually uses the .py files. Module-level statements (including those in a &lt;code&gt;if __name__=='__main__'&lt;/code&gt; section) are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; executed--I assumed that the stdout from running the script at the commandline would be what the server would output, but that's not how it works.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, I wrote a module-level function called &lt;code&gt;index()&lt;/code&gt;, and had it return as a string the HTML of the page. It's also possible to have other module-level functions (e.g., &lt;code&gt;otherFunction()&lt;/code&gt;) that can be accessed as further segments in the URI (e.g., &lt;code&gt;testScript/otherFunction&lt;/code&gt; for the file &lt;code&gt;testScript.py&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this makes more sense than my original stdout conception. Better capability of actually using Python as a scripting language and not a humongous markup language.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;There are two main ways of running Python on Apache. The simplest would be to use CGI and write normal Python scripts while the second is using a web framework like Django or Pylons.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Using CGI is straightforward. Make sure your Apache config file has a cgi-bin set up. If not, follow their documentation (&lt;a href=\"http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/cgi.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"&gt;http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/cgi.html&lt;/a&gt;). At that point all you need to do is place your Python scripts in the cgi-bin directory and the standard output will become the HTTP response. Refer to Python's documentation for further info (&lt;a href=\"https://docs.python.org/library/cgi.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"&gt;https://docs.python.org/library/cgi.html&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to use a web framework you'll need to setup mod_python or FastCGI. These steps are dependent on which framework you want to use. Django provides clear instructions on how to setup mod_python and Django with Apache (&lt;a href=\"http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/modpython/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"&gt;http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/modpython/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</td>\n",

       "0       <p>I needed to use class based views, but I wanted to be able to use the full name of the class in my URLconf without always having to instantiate the view class before using it. What helped me was a surprisingly simple metaclass:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>class CallableViewClass(type):\\n    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):\\n        if args and isinstance(args[0], HttpRequest):\\n            instance = super(CallableViewClass, cls).__call__()\\n            return instance.__call__(*args, **kwargs)\\n        else:\\n            instance = super(CallableViewClass, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)\\n            return instance\\n\\n\\nclass View(object):\\n    __metaclass__ = CallableViewClass\\n\\n    def __call__(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\\n        if hasattr(self, request.method):\\n            handler = getattr(self, request.method)\\n            if hasattr(handler, '__call__'):\\n                return handler(request, *args, **kwargs)\\n        return HttpResponseBadRequest('Method Not Allowed', status=405)\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>I can now both instantiate view classes and use the instances as view functions, OR I can simply point my URLconf to my class and have the metaclass instantiate (and call) the view class for me. This works by checking the first argument to <code>__call__</code> â€“ if it's a <code>HttpRequest</code>, it must be an actual HTTP request because it would be nonsense to attept to instantiate a view class with an <code>HttpRequest</code> instance.</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>class MyView(View):\\n    def __init__(self, arg=None):\\n        self.arg = arg\\n    def GET(request):\\n        return HttpResponse(self.arg or 'no args provided')\\n\\n@login_required\\nclass MyOtherView(View):\\n    def POST(request):\\n        pass\\n\\n# And all the following work as expected.\\nurlpatterns = patterns(''\\n    url(r'^myview1$', 'myapp.views.MyView', name='myview1'),\\n    url(r'^myview2$', myapp.views.MyView, name='myview2'),\\n    url(r'^myview3$', myapp.views.MyView('foobar'), name='myview3'),\\n    url(r'^myotherview$', 'myapp.views.MyOtherView', name='otherview'),\\n)\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>(I posted a snippet for this at <a href=\"http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/2041/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/2041/</a>)</p>\\n<p>I've created and used my own generic view classes, defining <strong><code>__call__</code></strong> so an instance of the class is callable.  I really like it; while Django's generic views allow some customization through keyword arguments, OO generic views (if their behavior is split into a number of separate methods) can have much more fine-grained customization via subclassing, which lets me repeat myself a lot less.  (I get tired of rewriting the same create/update view logic anytime I need to tweak something Django's generic views don't quite allow).</p>\\n\\n<p>I've posted some code at <a href=\"http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/1009/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">djangosnippets.org</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>The only real downside I see is the proliferation of internal method calls, which may impact performance somewhat. I don't think this is much of a concern; it's rare that Python code execution would be your performance bottleneck in a web app.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Django's own <a href=\"http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/class-based-views/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">generic views</a> are now class-based.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: FWIW, I've changed my opinion on class-based views since this answer was written. After having used them extensively on a couple of projects, I feel they tend to lead to code that is satisfyingly DRY to write, but very hard to read and maintain later, because functionality is spread across so many different places, and subclasses are so dependent on every implementation detail of the superclasses and mixins. I now feel that <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/template-response/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">TemplateResponse</a> and view decorators is a better answer for decomposing view code.</p>\\n<p>If you want to share common functionality between pages I suggest you look at custom tags. They're quite <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.1/howto/custom-template-tags/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">easy to create</a>, and are very powerful.</p>\\n\\n<p>Also, <a href=\"https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/ExtendingTemplates\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">templates can extend from other templates</a>. This allows you to have a base template to set up the layout of the page and to share this between other templates which fill in the blanks. You can nest templates to any depth; allowing you to specify the layout on separate groups of related pages in one place.</p>\\n<p>Sounds to me like you're trying to combine things that shouldn't be combined.  If you need to do different processing in your view depending on if it's a User or Group object you're trying to look at then you should use two different view functions.</p>\\n\\n<p>On the other hand there can be common ...  \n",

It compiles to an executable, and I then have an application executable.</p>\\n<p>Another system (not mentioned in the accepted answer yet) is PyInstaller, which worked for a PyQt project of mine when py2exe would not. I found it easier to use.</p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pyinstaller.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.pyinstaller.org/</a></p>\\n\\n<p>Pyinstaller is based on Gordon McMillan's Python Installer.

This is likely to create a large executable, however.</p>\\n\\n<p>MacOS X even includes support in the Xcode IDE for creating full standalone GUI apps.  These can be run by any user running OS X.</p>\\n<p>There's three things you could do:</p>\\n<p>The first thing is to find a GUI Designer that can launch its code as standalone applications like .exe files. I use a version of MatDeck (for people using GUI Designers I recommend <a href=\"https://labdeck.com/python-designer/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MD Python Designer</a>) as I believe(I use another version so I'm not too sure.) it allows me to convert the code to a standalone applications and by having it as such, there is no need to install the software on every PC that's going to run the program.</p>\\n<p>The second option is partially bypassing the problem, launch the GUI as a web page. This would give you the most compatibility as most if not all OS can utilize it. Once again, you would need a GUI Designer that can convert its components into a web compatible format, I've done it once and I used the same version of MatDeck(<a href=\"https://labdeck.com/visionary-deck/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Visionary Deck</a>), I would not recommend MD Python Designer this time as I don't know if it can turn its GUIs into websites using web assembly whereas Visionary Deck I've tried and tested. As with all things there are most likely other software this is just one I use frequently because I work a lot with Mathematics and Physics.</p>\\n<p>The third option is also kind of bypassing the problem but do it in Tkinter and just ensure you have a Python IDE or just plain old Python and run the code, this will launch the GUI. This is a good solution and maybe the simplest but I wouldn't class it as the shortest or the best. If you only plan to switch between a few operating systems and computers this will probably be your best bet.</p>\\n<pre><code># I'd use tkinter for python 3\\n\\nimport tkinter\\n\\ntk = tkinter.Tk()\\ntk.geometry(&quot;400x300+500+300&quot;)\\nl = Label(tk,text=&quot;&quot;)\\nl.pack()\\ne = Entry(tk)\\ne.pack()\\n\\ndef click():\\n    e['text'] = 'You clicked the button'\\n\\nb = Button(tk,text=&quot;Click me&quot;,command=click)\\nb.pack()\\n\\ntk.mainloop()\\n\\n# After this I would you py2exe\\n# search for the use of this module on stakoverflow\\n# otherwise I could edit this to let you know h...  \n",

Here's how I did it.</p>\\n\\n<p>In httpd.conf:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>LoadModule python_module modules/mod_python.so\\n\\n&lt;Directory \"/serverbase/htdocs/myapp\"&gt;\\n  AddHandler mod_python .py\\n  PythonHandler myapp\\n  PythonDebug On\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>and in your application directory:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>$ /serverbase/htdocs/myapp$ ls -l\\ntotal 16\\n-r-xr-xr-x 1 root sys        6484 May 21 15:54 myapp.py\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Repeat the configuration for each python program you wish to have running under mod_python.</p>\\n<p>Are you running Python on UNIX or Windows?</p>\\n\\n<p>An alternative to mod_python and FastCGI is mod_wsgi. You can find out more at <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">modwsgi</a></p>\\n\\n<p>I have built and installed this on Solaris without problems. I had previously tried mod_python but ran into problems with shared libraries as part of the build. There are <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/InstallationInstructions\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">good install docs</a> available.</p>\\n<p>The problem for me wasn't in Apache set up, but in understanding how mod_apache actually uses the .py files. Module-level statements (including those in a <code>if __name__=='__main__'</code> section) are <em>not</em> executed--I assumed that the stdout from running the script at the commandline would be what the server would output, but that's not how it works.</p>\\n\\n<p>Instead, I wrote a module-level function called <code>index()</code>, and had it return as a string the HTML of the page. It's also possible to have other module-level functions (e.g., <code>otherFunction()</code>) that can be accessed as further segments in the URI (e.g., <code>testScript/otherFunction</code> for the file <code>testScript.py</code>.)</p>\\n\\n<p>Obviously, this makes more sense than my original stdout conception. Better capability of actually using Python as a scripting language and not a humongous markup language.</p>\\n<p>There are two main ways of running Python on Apache. The simplest would be to use CGI and write normal Python scripts while the second is using a web framework like Django or Pylons.</p>\\n\\n<p>Using CGI is straightforward. Make sure your Apache config file has a cgi-bin set up. If not, follow their documentation (<a href=\"http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/cgi.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/cgi.html</a>). At that point all you need to do is place your Python scripts in the cgi-bin directory and the standard output will become the HTTP response. Refer to Python's documentation for further info (<a href=\"https://docs.python.org/library/cgi.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://docs.python.org/library/cgi.html</a>).</p>\\n\\n<p>If you want to use a web framework you'll need to setup mod_python or FastCGI. These steps are dependent on which framework you want to use. Django provides clear instructions on how to setup mod_python and Django with Apache (<a href=\"http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/modpython/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/modpython/</a>)</p>  \n",

       "0         Class views in Django  view points to a function, which can be a problem if you want to change only a bit of functionality. Yes, I could have million keyword arguments and even more if statements in the function, but I was thinking more of an object oriented approach.    For example, I have a page that displays a user. This page is very similar to page that displays a group, but it's still not so similar to just use another data model. Group also has members etc...    One way would be to point views to class methods and then extend that class. Has anyone tried this approach or has any other idea?  \n",

I've reviewed , but I've had trouble trying to apply them beyond a simple list of numbers.   So, how do I use of ?  Is there another technique I should be using?

       "0       Class views in Django  view points to a function, which can be a problem if you want to change only a bit of functionality. Yes, I could have million keyword arguments and even more if statements in the function, but I was thinking more of an object oriented approach.    For example, I have a page that displays a user. This page is very similar to page that displays a group, but it's still not so similar to just use another data model. Group also has members etc...    One way would be to point views to class methods and then extend that class. Has anyone tried this approach or has any other idea?    \n",
       "1                        How do I use itertools.groupby ? I haven't been able to find an understandable explanation of how to actually use Python's  function.  What I'm trying to do is this:     Take a list - in this case, the children of an objectified  element   Divide it into groups based on some criteria   Then later iterate over each of these groups separately.

Yes, I could have million keyword arguments and even more if statements in the function, but I was thinking more of an object oriented approach.    For example, I have a page that displays a user. This page is very similar to page that displays a group, but it's still not so similar to just use another data model. Group also has members etc...    One way would be to point views to class methods and then extend that class. Has anyone tried this approach or has any other idea?    \n",

Yes, I could have million keyword arguments and even more if statements in the function, but I was thinking more of an object oriented approach.    For example, I have a page that displays a user. This page is very similar to page that displays a group, but it's still not so similar to just use another data model. Group also has members etc...    One way would be to point views to class methods and then extend that class. Has anyone tried this approach or has any other idea?     \n",

Yes, I could have million keyword arguments and even more if statements in the function, but I was thinking more of an object oriented approach.    For example, I have a page that displays a user. This page is very similar to page that displays a group, but it's still not so similar to just use another data model. Group also has members etc...    One way would be to point views to class methods and then extend that class. Has anyone tried this approach or has any other idea?     \n",
