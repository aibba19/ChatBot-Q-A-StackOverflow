This allows you to have a base template to set up the layout of the page and to share this between other templates which fill in the blanks. You can nest templates to any depth; allowing you to specify the layout on separate groups of related pages in one place.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;If you're simply displaying data from models, why not use the &lt;a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/ref/generic-views/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"&gt;Django Generic Views&lt;/a&gt;? They're designed to let you easy show data from a model without having to write your own view and stuff about mapping URL paramaters to views, fetching data, handling edge cases, rendering output, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Sounds to me like you're trying to combine things that shouldn't be combined.  If you need to do different processing in your view depending on if it's a User or Group object you're trying to look at then you should use two different view functions.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand there can be common idioms you'd want to extract out of your object&amp;#95;detail type views... perhaps you could use a decorator or just helper functions?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;-Dan&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;You can use the Django Generic Views. You can easily achieve desired functionality thorough Django generic Views&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;I needed to use class based views, but I wanted to be able to use the full name of the class in my URLconf without always having to instantiate the view class before using it. What helped me was a surprisingly simple metaclass:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class CallableViewClass(type):\\n    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):\\n        if args and isinstance(args[0], HttpRequest):\\n            instance = super(CallableViewClass, cls).__call__()\\n            return instance.__call__(*args, **kwargs)\\n        else:\\n            instance = super(CallableViewClass, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)\\n            return instance\\n\\n\\nclass View(object):\\n    __metaclass__ = CallableViewClass\\n\\n    def __call__(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\\n        if hasattr(self, request.method):\\n            handler = getattr(self, request.method)\\n            if hasattr(handler, '__call__'):\\n                return handler(request, *args, **kwargs)\\n        return HttpResponseBadRequest('Method Not Allowed', status=405)\\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can now both instantiate view classes and use the instances as view functions, OR I can simply point my URLconf to my class and have the metaclass instantiate (and call) the view class for me. This works by checking the first argument to &lt;code&gt;__call__&lt;/code&gt; â€“ if it's a &lt;code&gt;HttpRequest&lt;/code&gt;, it must be an actual HTTP request because it would be nonsense to attept to instantiate a view class with an &lt;code&gt;HttpRequest&lt;/code&gt; instance.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class MyView(View):\\n    def __init__(self, arg=None):\\n        self.arg = arg\\n    def GET(request):\\n        return HttpResponse(self.arg or 'no args provided')\\n\\n@login_required\\nclass MyOtherView(View):\\n    def POST(request):\\n        pass\\n\\n# And all the following work as expected.\\nurlpatterns = patterns(''\\n    url(r'^myview1$', 'myapp.views.MyView', name='myview1'),\\n    url(r'^myview2$', myapp.views.MyView, name='myview2'),\\n    url(r'^myview3$', myapp.views.MyView('foobar'), name='myview3'),\\n    url(r'^myotherview$', 'myapp.views.MyOtherView', name='otherview'),\\n)\\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(I posted a snippet for this at &lt;a href=\"http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/2041/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"&gt;http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/2041/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;You can always create a class, override the &lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;__call__&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; function and then point the URL file to an instance of the class. You can take a look at the &lt;a href=\"http://code.djangoproject.com/browser/django/trunk/django/contrib/formtools/wizard.py\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"&gt;FormWizard&lt;/a&gt; class to see how this is done.&lt;/p&gt;</td>\n",

You give groupby an iterable, and a optional &lt;strong&gt;key&lt;/strong&gt; function/callable by which to check the items as they come out of the iterable, and it returns an iterator that gives a two-tuple of the result of the key callable and the actual items in another iterable. From the help:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;groupby(iterable[, keyfunc]) -&amp;gt; create an iterator which returns\\n(key, sub-iterator) grouped by each value of key(value).\\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of groupby using a coroutine to group by a count, it uses a key callable (in this case, &lt;code&gt;coroutine.send&lt;/code&gt;) to just spit out the count for however many iterations and a grouped sub-iterator of elements:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import itertools\\n\\n\\ndef grouper(iterable, n):\\n    def coroutine(n):\\n        yield # queue up coroutine\\n        for i in itertools.count():\\n            for j in range(n):\\n                yield i\\n    groups = coroutine(n)\\n    next(groups) # queue up coroutine\\n\\n    for c, objs in itertools.groupby(iterable, groups.send):\\n        yield c, list(objs)\\n    # or instead of materializing a list of objs, just:\\n    # return itertools.groupby(iterable, groups.send)\\n\\nlist(grouper(range(10), 3))\\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;prints&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[(0, [0, 1, 2]), (1, [3, 4, 5]), (2, [6, 7, 8]), (3, [9])]\\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;I would like to give another example where groupby without sort is not working. Adapted from example by James Sulak&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;from itertools import groupby\\n\\nthings = [(\"vehicle\", \"bear\"), (\"animal\", \"duck\"), (\"animal\", \"cactus\"), (\"vehicle\", \"speed boat\"), (\"vehicle\", \"school bus\")]\\n\\nfor key, group in groupby(things, lambda x: x[0]):\\n    for thing in group:\\n        print \"A %s is a %s.\" % (thing[1], key)\\n    print \" \"\\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;output is&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;A bear is a vehicle.\\n\\nA duck is a animal.\\nA cactus is a animal.\\n\\nA speed boat is a vehicle.\\nA school bus is a vehicle.\\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;there are two groups with vehicule, whereas one could expect only one group&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Another example:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for key, igroup in itertools.groupby(xrange(12), lambda x: x // 5):\\n    print key, list(igroup)\\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;results in&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;0 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\\n1 [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\\n2 [10, 11]\\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Note that igroup is an iterator (a sub-iterator as the documentation calls it).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This is useful for chunking a generator:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def chunker(items, chunk_size):\\n    '''Group items in chunks of chunk_size'''\\n    for _key, group in itertools.groupby(enumerate(items), lambda x: x[0] // chunk_size):\\n        yield (g[1] for g in group)\\n\\nwith open('file.txt') as fobj:\\n    for chunk in chunker(fobj):\\n        process(chunk)\\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Another example of groupby - when the keys are not sorted.  In the following example, items in xx are grouped by values in yy.  In this case, one set of zeros is output first, followed by a set of ones, followed again by a set of zeros.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;xx = range(10)\\nyy = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\\nfor group in itertools.groupby(iter(xx), lambda x: yy[x]):\\n    print group[0], list(group[1])\\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Produces:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;0 [0, 1, 2]\\n1 [3, 4, 5]\\n0 [6, 7, 8, 9]\\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;One useful example that I came across may be helpful:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;from itertools import groupby\\n\\n#user input\\n\\nmyinput = input()\\n\\n#creating empty list to store output\\n\\nmyoutput = []\\n\\nfor k,g in groupby(myinput):\\n\\n    myoutput.append((len(list(g)),int(k)))\\n\\nprint(*myoutput)\\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Sample input: 14445221&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Sample output: (1,1) (3,4) (1,5) (2,2) (1,1)&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This basic implementation helped me understand this function. Hope it helps others as well:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"&gt;&lt;code&gt;arr = [(1, \"A\"), (1, \"B\"), (1, \"C\"), (2, \"D\"), (2, \"E\"), (3, \"F\")]\\n\\nfor k,g in groupby(arr, lambda x: x[0]):\\n    print(\"--\", k, \"--\")\\n    for tup in g:\\n        print(tup[1])  # tup[0] == k\\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\\n\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;-- 1 --\\nA\\nB\\nC\\n-- 2 --\\nD\\nE\\n-- 3 --\\nF\\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;A neato trick with groupby is to run length encoding in one line:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[(c,len(list(cgen))) for c,cgen in groupby(some_string)]\\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;will give you a list of 2-tuples where the first element is the char and the 2nd is the number of repetitions.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Note that this is what separates &lt;code&gt;itertools.groupby&lt;/code&gt; from the SQL &lt;code&gt;GROUP BY&lt;/code&gt; semantics: itertools doesn't (and in general can't) sort the iterator in advance, so groups with the same \"key\" aren't merged.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;@CaptSolo, I tried your example, but it didn't work.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;from itertools import groupby \\n[(c,len(list(cs))) for c,cs in groupby('Pedro Manoel')]\\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Output:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[(...</td>\n",

Module-level statements (including those in a &lt;code&gt;if __name__=='__main__'&lt;/code&gt; section) are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; executed--I assumed that the stdout from running the script at the commandline would be what the server would output, but that's not how it works.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, I wrote a module-level function called &lt;code&gt;index()&lt;/code&gt;, and had it return as a string the HTML of the page. It's also possible to have other module-level functions (e.g., &lt;code&gt;otherFunction()&lt;/code&gt;) that can be accessed as further segments in the URI (e.g., &lt;code&gt;testScript/otherFunction&lt;/code&gt; for the file &lt;code&gt;testScript.py&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this makes more sense than my original stdout conception. Better capability of actually using Python as a scripting language and not a humongous markup language.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Are you running Python on UNIX or Windows?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;An alternative to mod_python and FastCGI is mod_wsgi.

If you need to do different processing in your view depending on if it's a User or Group object you're trying to look at then you should use two different view functions.</p>\\n\\n<p>On the other hand there can be common idioms you'd want to extract out of your object&#95;detail type views... perhaps you could use a decorator or just helper functions?</p>\\n\\n<p>-Dan</p>\\n<p>You can use the Django Generic Views. You can easily achieve desired functionality thorough Django generic Views</p>\\n<p>I needed to use class based views, but I wanted to be able to use the full name of the class in my URLconf without always having to instantiate the view class before using it. What helped me was a surprisingly simple metaclass:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>class CallableViewClass(type):\\n    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):\\n        if args and isinstance(args[0], HttpRequest):\\n            instance = super(CallableViewClass, cls).__call__()\\n            return instance.__call__(*args, **kwargs)\\n        else:\\n            instance = super(CallableViewClass, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)\\n            return instance\\n\\n\\nclass View(object):\\n    __metaclass__ = CallableViewClass\\n\\n    def __call__(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\\n        if hasattr(self, request.method):\\n            handler = getattr(self, request.method)\\n            if hasattr(handler, '__call__'):\\n                return handler(request, *args, **kwargs)\\n        return HttpResponseBadRequest('Method Not Allowed', status=405)\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>I can now both instantiate view classes and use the instances as view functions, OR I can simply point my URLconf to my class and have the metaclass instantiate (and call) the view class for me. This works by checking the first argument to <code>__call__</code> â€“ if it's a <code>HttpRequest</code>, it must be an actual HTTP request because it would be nonsense to attept to instantiate a view class with an <code>HttpRequest</code> instance.</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>class MyView(View):\\n    def __init__(self, arg=None):\\n        self.arg = arg\\n    def GET(request):\\n        return HttpResponse(self.arg or 'no args provided')\\n\\n@login_required\\nclass MyOtherView(View):\\n    def POST(request):\\n        pass\\n\\n# And all the following work as expected.\\nurlpatterns = patterns(''\\n    url(r'^myview1$', 'myapp.views.MyView', name='myview1'),\\n    url(r'^myview2$', myapp.views.MyView, name='myview2'),\\n    url(r'^myview3$', myapp.views.MyView('foobar'), name='myview3'),\\n    url(r'^myotherview$', 'myapp.views.MyOtherView', name='otherview'),\\n)\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>(I posted a snippet for this at <a href=\"http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/2041/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/2041/</a>)</p>\\n<p>You can always create a class, override the <em><code>__call__</code></em> function and then point the URL file to an instance of the class.

       "1  <blockquote>\\n  <p><strong>How do I use Python's itertools.groupby()?</strong></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>You can use groupby to group things to iterate over. You give groupby an iterable, and a optional <strong>key</strong> function/callable by which to check the items as they come out of the iterable, and it returns an iterator that gives a two-tuple of the result of the key callable and the actual items in another iterable. From the help:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>groupby(iterable[, keyfunc]) -&gt; create an iterator which returns\\n(key, sub-iterator) grouped by each value of key(value).\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Here's an example of groupby using a coroutine to group by a count, it uses a key callable (in this case, <code>coroutine.send</code>) to just spit out the count for however many iterations and a grouped sub-iterator of elements:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>import itertools\\n\\n\\ndef grouper(iterable, n):\\n    def coroutine(n):\\n        yield # queue up coroutine\\n        for i in itertools.count():\\n            for j in range(n):\\n                yield i\\n    groups = coroutine(n)\\n    next(groups) # queue up coroutine\\n\\n    for c, objs in itertools.groupby(iterable, groups.send):\\n        yield c, list(objs)\\n    # or instead of materializing a list of objs, just:\\n    # return itertools.groupby(iterable, groups.send)\\n\\nlist(grouper(range(10), 3))\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>prints</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>[(0, [0, 1, 2]), (1, [3, 4, 5]), (2, [6, 7, 8]), (3, [9])]\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>I would like to give another example where groupby without sort is not working.

Module-level statements (including those in a <code>if __name__=='__main__'</code> section) are <em>not</em> executed--I assumed that the stdout from running the script at the commandline would be what the server would output, but that's not how it works.</p>\\n\\n<p>Instead, I wrote a module-level function called <code>index()</code>, and had it return as a string the HTML of the page. It's also possible to have other module-level functions (e.g., <code>otherFunction()</code>) that can be accessed as further segments in the URI (e.g., <code>testScript/otherFunction</code> for the file <code>testScript.py</code>.)</p>\\n\\n<p>Obviously, this makes more sense than my original stdout conception. Better capability of actually using Python as a scripting language and not a humongous markup language.</p>\\n<p>Are you running Python on UNIX or Windows?</p>\\n\\n<p>An alternative to mod_python and FastCGI is mod_wsgi. You can find out more at <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">modwsgi</a></p>\\n\\n<p>I have built and installed this on Solaris without problems. I had previously tried mod_python but ran into problems with shared libraries as part of the build. There are <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/InstallationInstructions\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">good install docs</a> available.</p>  "

If I understand correctly there are four edges being defined with an index starting from 0 Is this assumption wrong? Also, what does  mean?    is a class, so I won't expect it to return anything Class definition is here:   I read the documentation  should be Node feature matrix and  should be graph connectivity But I don't understand the console output that I cross-checked in the jupyter notebook</td>\n",

       "      <td>How to increase/change a value in a dataset with a condition in python What I want to do is: create a for loop that iterates through the data, if the probability ends in an even number I want to add 01 to it, if the color is red I want to increase the cost of that item by 10%   Something is wrong with my syntax I can't figure how to correctly do what I want I keep getting this error:  Also, can I use %2 if the value is a float?   Please help Thank you   Here's my code:      Here's the dataset I'm working with: There are four columns (Color, Probability, Flower, &amp;amp; Cost) and 20 rows</td>\n",

       "0       Class views in Django  view points to a function, which can be a problem if you want to change only a bit of functionality Yes, I could have million keyword arguments and even more if statements in the function, but I was thinking more of an object oriented approach    For example, I have a page that displays a user This page is very similar to page that displays a group, but it's still not so similar to just use another data model Group also has members etc    One way would be to point views to class methods and then extend that class Has anyone tried this approach or has any other idea?     \n",
