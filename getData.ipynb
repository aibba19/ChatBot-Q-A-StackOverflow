This works by checking the first argument to &lt;code&gt;__call__&lt;/code&gt; â€“ if it's a &lt;code&gt;HttpRequest&lt;/code&gt;, it must be an actual HTTP request because it would be nonsense to attept to instantiate a view class with an &lt;code&gt;HttpRequest&lt;/code&gt; instance.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class MyView(View):\\n    def __init__(self, arg=None):\\n        self.arg = arg\\n    def GET(request):\\n        return HttpResponse(self.arg or 'no args provided')\\n\\n@login_required\\nclass MyOtherView(View):\\n    def POST(request):\\n        pass\\n\\n# And all the following work as expected.\\nurlpatterns = patterns(''\\n    url(r'^myview1$', 'myapp.views.MyView', name='myview1'),\\n    url(r'^myview2$', myapp.views.MyView, name='myview2'),\\n    url(r'^myview3$', myapp.views.MyView('foobar'), name='myview3'),\\n    url(r'^myotherview$', 'myapp.views.MyOtherView', name='otherview'),\\n)\\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(I posted a snippet for this at &lt;a href=\"http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/2041/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"&gt;http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/2041/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Unless you want to do something a little complex, using the generic views are the way to go.  They are far more powerful than their name implies, and if you are just displaying model data generic views will do the job.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;You can always create a class, override the &lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;__call__&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; function and then point the URL file to an instance of the class. You can take a look at the &lt;a href=\"http://code.djangoproject.com/browser/django/trunk/django/contrib/formtools/wizard.py\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"&gt;FormWizard&lt;/a&gt; class to see how this is done.&lt;/p&gt;</td>\n",

It compiles to an executable, and I then have an application executable.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;There's three things you could do:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The first thing is to find a GUI Designer that can launch its code as standalone applications like .exe files. I use a version of MatDeck (for people using GUI Designers I recommend &lt;a href=\"https://labdeck.com/python-designer/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"&gt;MD Python Designer&lt;/a&gt;) as I believe(I use another version so I'm not too sure.) it allows me to convert the code to a standalone applications and by having it as such, there is no need to install the software on every PC that's going to run the program.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The second option is partially bypassing the problem, launch the GUI as a web page. This would give you the most compatibility as most if not all OS can utilize it. Once again, you would need a GUI Designer that can convert its components into a web compatible format, I've done it once and I used the same version of MatDeck(&lt;a href=\"https://labdeck.com/visionary-deck/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"&gt;Visionary Deck&lt;/a&gt;), I would not recommend MD Python Designer this time as I don't know if it can turn its GUIs into websites using web assembly whereas Visionary Deck I've tried and tested. As with all things there are most likely other software this is just one I use frequently because I work a lot with Mathematics and Physics.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The third option is also kind of bypassing the problem but do it in Tkinter and just ensure you have a Python IDE or just plain old Python and run the code, this will launch the GUI. This is a good solution and maybe the simplest but I wouldn't class it as the shortest or the best. If you only plan to switch between a few operating systems and computers this will probably be your best bet.&lt;/p&gt;</td>\n",

Anyways, I'm working on a python assignment where I have to square a number using return values. Here's the instructions:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Write a function to square a number using return values. Squaring a number means multiplying it by itself (duh). Then make several calls to that function in your start function to test it out. Your square function should only return a value, not print anything.\\nFor example a function call like\\nx = square(5)\\nshould put the value 25 in x.\\nPrint out x to be sure your function returns the correct value.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;And here's the code I ended with. I'm sure it's not great, but it's a simple assignment that just wants me to return a function- no more, no less. But with the information I was given, I just can't figure it out:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def square(x): \\n    squared = x * x\\n    return squared\\n    print(squared)\\n\\nprint(square(5))\\nprint(square(9))\\nprint(square(8))\\n#above is just me 'testing' the code. If I don't include it, the checker tells me its wrong. \\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The code works fine when it comes to squaring whatever number I give it, and the code itself includes the return function as stated. However, it says it's wrong and to &amp;quot;Store the return value so you can verify it is correct.&amp;quot; I looked in all of the lessons and videos and I can't find anything about storing a return value to verify it. Any help?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;P.S. Sorry if the formatting is wrong.

       "86992  <p>Okay, so I'm sure this is a pretty simple assignment, but I'm having a lot of trouble with it because online classes suck and I just started coding. Anyways, I'm working on a python assignment where I have to square a number using return values. Here's the instructions:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Write a function to square a number using return values. Squaring a number means multiplying it by itself (duh). Then make several calls to that function in your start function to test it out. Your square function should only return a value, not print anything.\\nFor example a function call like\\nx = square(5)\\nshould put the value 25 in x.\\nPrint out x to be sure your function returns the correct value.&quot;</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>And here's the code I ended with. I'm sure it's not great, but it's a simple assignment that just wants me to return a function- no more, no less. But with the information I was given, I just can't figure it out:</p>\\n<pre><code>def square(x): \\n    squared = x * x\\n    return squared\\n    print(squared)\\n\\nprint(square(5))\\nprint(square(9))\\nprint(square(8))\\n#above is just me 'testing' the code. If I don't include it, the checker tells me its wrong. \\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The code works fine when it comes to squaring whatever number I give it, and the code itself includes the return function as stated. However, it says it's wrong and to &quot;Store the return value so you can verify it is correct.&quot; I looked in all of the lessons and videos and I can't find anything about storing a return value to verify it. Any help?</p>\\n<p>P.S. Sorry if the formatting is wrong. I literally just made an account 10 minutes ago because I'm kind of desperate for someone smarter than me to tell me what it is I'm doing wrong.</p>   \n",

       "0      <p>I needed to use class based views, but I wanted to be able to use the full name of the class in my URLconf without always having to instantiate the view class before using it. What helped me was a surprisingly simple metaclass:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>class CallableViewClass(type):\\n    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):\\n        if args and isinstance(args[0], HttpRequest):\\n            instance = super(CallableViewClass, cls).__call__()\\n            return instance.__call__(*args, **kwargs)\\n        else:\\n            instance = super(CallableViewClass, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)\\n            return instance\\n\\n\\nclass View(object):\\n    __metaclass__ = CallableViewClass\\n\\n    def __call__(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\\n        if hasattr(self, request.method):\\n            handler = getattr(self, request.method)\\n            if hasattr(handler, '__call__'):\\n                return handler(request, *args, **kwargs)\\n        return HttpResponseBadRequest('Method Not Allowed', status=405)\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>I can now both instantiate view classes and use the instances as view functions, OR I can simply point my URLconf to my class and have the metaclass instantiate (and call) the view class for me. This works by checking the first argument to <code>__call__</code> â€“ if it's a <code>HttpRequest</code>, it must be an actual HTTP request because it would be nonsense to attept to instantiate a view class with an <code>HttpRequest</code> instance.</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>class MyView(View):\\n    def __init__(self, arg=None):\\n        self.arg = arg\\n    def GET(request):\\n        return HttpResponse(self.arg or 'no args provided')\\n\\n@login_required\\nclass MyOtherView(View):\\n    def POST(request):\\n        pass\\n\\n# And all the following work as expected.\\nurlpatterns = patterns(''\\n    url(r'^myview1$', 'myapp.views.MyView', name='myview1'),\\n    url(r'^myview2$', myapp.views.MyView, name='myview2'),\\n    url(r'^myview3$', myapp.views.MyView('foobar'), name='myview3'),\\n    url(r'^myotherview$', 'myapp.views.MyOtherView', name='otherview'),\\n)\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>(I posted a snippet for this at <a href=\"http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/2041/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/2041/</a>)</p>\\n<p>Unless you want to do something a little complex, using the generic views are the way to go.  They are far more powerful than their name implies, and if you are just displaying model data generic views will do the job.</p>\\n<p>You can always create a class, override the <em><code>__call__</code></em> function and then point the URL file to an instance of the class. You can take a look at the <a href=\"http://code.djangoproject.com/browser/django/trunk/django/contrib/formtools/wizard.py\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">FormWizard</a> class to see how this is done.</p>  \n",

It compiles to an executable, and I then have an application executable.</p>\\n<p>There's three things you could do:</p>\\n<p>The first thing is to find a GUI Designer that can launch its code as standalone applications like .exe files. I use a version of MatDeck (for people using GUI Designers I recommend <a href=\"https://labdeck.com/python-designer/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MD Python Designer</a>) as I believe(I use another version so I'm not too sure.) it allows me to convert the code to a standalone applications and by having it as such, there is no need to install the software on every PC that's going to run the program.</p>\\n<p>The second option is partially bypassing the problem, launch the GUI as a web page. This would give you the most compatibility as most if not all OS can utilize it. Once again, you would need a GUI Designer that can convert its components into a web compatible format, I've done it once and I used the same version of MatDeck(<a href=\"https://labdeck.com/visionary-deck/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Visionary Deck</a>), I would not recommend MD Python Designer this time as I don't know if it can turn its GUIs into websites using web assembly whereas Visionary Deck I've tried and tested. As with all things there are most likely other software this is just one I use frequently because I work a lot with Mathematics and Physics.</p>\\n<p>The third option is also kind of bypassing the problem but do it in Tkinter and just ensure you have a Python IDE or just plain old Python and run the code, this will launch the GUI. This is a good solution and maybe the simplest but I wouldn't class it as the shortest or the best. If you only plan to switch between a few operating systems and computers this will probably be your best bet.</p>  \n",

Yes, I could have million keyword arguments and even more if statements in the function, but I was thinking more of an object oriented approach.    For example, I have a page that displays a user. This page is very similar to page that displays a group, but it's still not so similar to just use another data model. Group also has members etc...    One way would be to point views to class methods and then extend that class. Has anyone tried this approach or has any other idea?  \n",

I haven't been able to find an understandable explanation of how to actually use Python's  function.  What I'm trying to do is this:     Take a list - in this case, the children of an objectified  element   Divide it into groups based on some criteria   Then later iterate over each of these groups separately.     I've reviewed , but I've had trouble trying to apply them beyond a simple list of numbers.   So, how do I use of ?  Is there another technique I should be using?

A researcher has created a small simulation in MATLAB and we want to make it accessible to others. My plan is to take the simulation, clean up a few things and turn it into a set of functions. Then I plan to compile it into a C library and use SWIG to create a Python wrapper. At that point, I should be able to call the simulation from a small Django app. At least I hope so.    Do I have the right plan? Has anyone else done something similar? Can you let me know if there are any serious pitfalls that I'm not aware of at the moment? \n",

       "86992    Squaring a number using return values Okay, so I'm sure this is a pretty simple assignment, but I'm having a lot of trouble with it because online classes suck and I just started coding. Anyways, I'm working on a python assignment where I have to square a number using return values. Here's the instructions:    And here's the code I ended with. I'm sure it's not great, but it's a simple assignment that just wants me to return a function- no more, no less. But with the information I was given, I just can't figure it out:      The code works fine when it comes to squaring whatever number I give it, and the code itself includes the return function as stated. However, it says it's wrong and to &quot;Store the return value so you can verify it is correct.&quot; I looked in all of the lessons and videos and I can't find anything about storing a return value to verify it. Any help?   P.S. Sorry if the formatting is wrong. I literally just made an account 10 minutes ago because I'm kind of desperate for someone smarter than me to tell me what it is I'm doing wrong. \n",

This page is very similar to page that displays a group, but it's still not so similar to just use another data model. Group also has members etc...

       "      <td>Squaring a number using return values Okay, so I'm sure this is a pretty simple assignment, but I'm having a lot of trouble with it because online classes suck and I just started coding. Anyways, I'm working on a python assignment where I have to square a number using return values. Here's the instructions:    And here's the code I ended with. I'm sure it's not great, but it's a simple assignment that just wants me to return a function- no more, no less. But with the information I was given, I just can't figure it out:      The code works fine when it comes to squaring whatever number I give it, and the code itself includes the return function as stated. However, it says it's wrong and to &amp;quot;Store the return value so you can verify it is correct.&amp;quot; I looked in all of the lessons and videos and I can't find anything about storing a return value to verify it. Any help?   P.S. Sorry if the formatting is wrong. I literally just made an account 10 minutes ago because I'm kind of desperate for someone smarter than me to tell me what it is I'm doing wrong.</td>\n",

Yes, I could have million keyword arguments and even more if statements in the function, but I was thinking more of an object oriented approach.    For example, I have a page that displays a user. This page is very similar to page that displays a group, but it's still not so similar to just use another data model. Group also has members etc...    One way would be to point views to class methods and then extend that class. Has anyone tried this approach or has any other idea?    \n",

I haven't been able to find an understandable explanation of how to actually use Python's  function.  What I'm trying to do is this:     Take a list - in this case, the children of an objectified  element   Divide it into groups based on some criteria   Then later iterate over each of these groups separately.     I've reviewed , but I've had trouble trying to apply them beyond a simple list of numbers.   So, how do I use of ?  Is there another technique I should be using?

A researcher has created a small simulation in MATLAB and we want to make it accessible to others. My plan is to take the simulation, clean up a few things and turn it into a set of functions. Then I plan to compile it into a C library and use SWIG to create a Python wrapper. At that point, I should be able to call the simulation from a small Django app. At least I hope so.    Do I have the right plan? Has anyone else done something similar? Can you let me know if there are any serious pitfalls that I'm not aware of at the moment?   \n",

       "86992  Squaring a number using return values Okay, so I'm sure this is a pretty simple assignment, but I'm having a lot of trouble with it because online classes suck and I just started coding. Anyways, I'm working on a python assignment where I have to square a number using return values. Here's the instructions:    And here's the code I ended with. I'm sure it's not great, but it's a simple assignment that just wants me to return a function- no more, no less. But with the information I was given, I just can't figure it out:      The code works fine when it comes to squaring whatever number I give it, and the code itself includes the return function as stated. However, it says it's wrong and to &quot;Store the return value so you can verify it is correct.&quot; I looked in all of the lessons and videos and I can't find anything about storing a return value to verify it. Any help?   P.S. Sorry if the formatting is wrong. I literally just made an account 10 minutes ago because I'm kind of desperate for someone smarter than me to tell me what it is I'm doing wrong.   \n",

Yes, I could have million keyword arguments and even more if statements in the function, but I was thinking more of an object oriented approach.    For example, I have a page that displays a user. This page is very similar to page that displays a group, but it's still not so similar to just use another data model. Group also has members etc...    One way would be to point views to class methods and then extend that class. Has anyone tried this approach or has any other idea?</td>\n",

So, I've got a  array that contains zeros in some indices:      And another  array, with the same shape, that may or may not contain zeros  :      I need to subtract  from  only where  is not zero.   So, my result should be:      Notice that because I'm not subtracting when  is zero, the zeros stay in place.

Yes, I could have million keyword arguments and even more if statements in the function, but I was thinking more of an object oriented approach.    For example, I have a page that displays a user. This page is very similar to page that displays a group, but it's still not so similar to just use another data model. Group also has members etc...    One way would be to point views to class methods and then extend that class. Has anyone tried this approach or has any other idea?    \n",

I have imagined a very simple authentication mechanism where people just enter their email address, and gets sent a unique login url, that sets a cookie that will always identify them for future requests.    In my template setup, I have base.html, and the other pages extend this. I want to show logged in or register button in the base.html, but how can I ensure that the necessary variables are always a part of the context? It seems that each view just sets up the context as they like, and there is no global context population. Is there a way of doing this without including the user in each context creation?    Or will I have to make my own custom shortcuts to setup the context properly?   \n",

       "86987  How to subtract a NumPy array from another one with a condition on the elements of the first one This question sounds like it may have already been solved, but even though I looked, I couldn't find an answer.   So, I've got a  array that contains zeros in some indices:      And another  array, with the same shape, that may or may not contain zeros  :      I need to subtract  from  only where  is not zero.   So, my result should be:      Notice that because I'm not subtracting when  is zero, the zeros stay in place.   First, I tried using a mask:      But the mask, of course, only returns the elements that are not zero and all the information about the indices is lost, so this fails:      Then, I tried using  with the argument :      But it resulted in this  :      I've also thought of using  to get the non-zero indices and then iterate over them and subtract the elements, but my arrays can be quite large and can contain either almost all zeros or almost no zeros, so in the latter case, it could become a expensive operation in terms of time.   Is there a simple way to achieve my desired result?   \n",

Yes, I could have million keyword arguments and even more if statements in the function, but I was thinking more of an object oriented approach.    For example, I have a page that displays a user. This page is very similar to page that displays a group, but it's still not so similar to just use another data model. Group also has members etc...    One way would be to point views to class methods and then extend that class. Has anyone tried this approach or has any other idea?     \n",

I have imagined a very simple authentication mechanism where people just enter their email address, and gets sent a unique login url, that sets a cookie that will always identify them for future requests.    In my template setup, I have base.html, and the other pages extend this. I want to show logged in or register button in the base.html, but how can I ensure that the necessary variables are always a part of the context? It seems that each view just sets up the context as they like, and there is no global context population. Is there a way of doing this without including the user in each context creation?    Or will I have to make my own custom shortcuts to setup the context properly?    \n",

       "86987  How to subtract a NumPy array from another one with a condition on the elements of the first one This question sounds like it may have already been solved, but even though I looked, I couldn't find an answer.   So, I've got a  array that contains zeros in some indices:      And another  array, with the same shape, that may or may not contain zeros  :      I need to subtract  from  only where  is not zero.   So, my result should be:      Notice that because I'm not subtracting when  is zero, the zeros stay in place.   First, I tried using a mask:      But the mask, of course, only returns the elements that are not zero and all the information about the indices is lost, so this fails:      Then, I tried using  with the argument :      But it resulted in this  :      I've also thought of using  to get the non-zero indices and then iterate over them and subtract the elements, but my arrays can be quite large and can contain either almost all zeros or almost no zeros, so in the latter case, it could become a expensive operation in terms of time.   Is there a simple way to achieve my desired result?    \n",

In the answer to this , I see the approach to plot the normal later, however it is done on some random data averaged around 0.    \n",

First, I tried using a mask:      But the mask, of course, only returns the elements that are not zero and all the information about the indices is lost, so this fails:      Then, I tried using  with the argument :      But it resulted in this  :      I've also thought of using  to get the non-zero indices and then iterate over them and subtract the elements, but my arrays can be quite large and can contain either almost all zeros or almost no zeros, so in the latter case, it could become a expensive operation in terms of time.   Is there a simple way to achieve my desired result?</td>\n",

Yes, I could have million keyword arguments and even more if statements in the function, but I was thinking more of an object oriented approach.    For example, I have a page that displays a user. This page is very similar to page that displays a group, but it's still not so similar to just use another data model. Group also has members etc...    One way would be to point views to class methods and then extend that class. Has anyone tried this approach or has any other idea?     \n",

I have imagined a very simple authentication mechanism where people just enter their email address, and gets sent a unique login url, that sets a cookie that will always identify them for future requests.    In my template setup, I have base.html, and the other pages extend this. I want to show logged in or register button in the base.html, but how can I ensure that the necessary variables are always a part of the context? It seems that each view just sets up the context as they like, and there is no global context population. Is there a way of doing this without including the user in each context creation?    Or will I have to make my own custom shortcuts to setup the context properly?    \n",

       "86987  How to subtract a NumPy array from another one with a condition on the elements of the first one This question sounds like it may have already been solved, but even though I looked, I couldn't find an answer.   So, I've got a  array that contains zeros in some indices:      And another  array, with the same shape, that may or may not contain zeros  :      I need to subtract  from  only where  is not zero.   So, my result should be:      Notice that because I'm not subtracting when  is zero, the zeros stay in place.   First, I tried using a mask:      But the mask, of course, only returns the elements that are not zero and all the information about the indices is lost, so this fails:      Then, I tried using  with the argument :      But it resulted in this  :      I've also thought of using  to get the non-zero indices and then iterate over them and subtract the elements, but my arrays can be quite large and can contain either almost all zeros or almost no zeros, so in the latter case, it could become a expensive operation in terms of time.   Is there a simple way to achieve my desired result?    \n",

The previous function had the option to draw a normal curve.      the fit=stats.norm doesn't work with displot anymore. In the answer to this , I see the approach to plot the normal later, however it is done on some random data averaged around 0.    \n",
